			About Me:
		</h2>
		<p>
			My name is Hriday.I'm from Karimnagar. I'm pursuing my Masters in IT field at IIIT,Hyderabad. I finished my engineering from Malla Reddy Enginnering College. My hobbies are playing chess and badminton.
		
		<p>
			Initially, when I was joined in MSIT I felt little bit uncomfortable because  I don't have any friends of mine. Moreover, it consists of guys who are hyper active in every aspect. So, it didn't take much time to mingle with them at the end of the day I made bunch of friends. <br>
		
			We people had a quality time spent in classes, labs and canteen. We have also adapted learning by doing here, which is more effective in understanding concepts. Mentors and PCs are available all the time to helps us when we are strucked.
