Task 1 - Postgresql:

I have created an account in heroku and created a new app named "nani-app" and selected "Heroku Postgres" add-on. Selected "Hobby Dev" plan for free access of  PostgreSQL database.
In this session there are no tricky steps and it is easily done with given description. Time elapsed for this task in nearly 15 to 20mins.



Task 2 - Python and Flask:

I have already installed python and pip. Then I downloaded the project11 file and installed the requirements with given command. I have tried to set the environmental variables and started flask run but it does not work and some errors are displayed. I googled them and tried to understand them but the solution in google does not help me. Then, I dropped a message in gitter with the error message and our mentor has given some suggestions like add these environmental variables to the system's environmental variables. Again I tried flask run but still I found same result. Then me and mentor had a zoom meeting and he checked everything and asked to me to use these two command try flask run. And finally its worked.

commands I tried:
pip3 uninstall werkzeug
pip3 install werkzeug==0.16.0

A lot of time was consumed for this task because of those error which was little bit tricky.


Task 3 - Goodreads API:

I faced an issue while doing this task that requests not found. Then I googled it and came to know that need to install the requests by using command "pip install requests" then it works and displayed a dictionary. For this task I have taken nearly 30mins.
